##### feel free to add your own questions in here

---

### Please create a restful API where crud operations can be performed on the questions we entered.

#### The server will include the following end points:

1. GET /list - to **list** all the questions from our database
2. PUT /update - to **update** a question by its default id we got from `Mongo`
3. POST /create - to **create** a question
4. DELETE /remove/:id - to **delete** a question by its id
5. GET /read/by/difficulty/:difficulty - to **list** all question with that difficulty **or above**

### Clarifications:

1. No need to build a front-end. You may use `Postman`.
2. Validate incoming requests before sending them to mongoDB (For example - there is no reason to send an untitled question to Mongo)
3. Submit your repo to the classroom
